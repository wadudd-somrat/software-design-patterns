1. We define a TextComponent interface (or abstract class) that declares a render method. This represents the component interface that both concrete components and decorators will implement.

2. We create a concrete text component class, PlainText, that implements the TextComponent interface. It represents plain text content.

3. We define two decorator classes, BoldDecorator and ItalicDecorator, both of which also implement the TextComponent interface. These decorators take a reference to a TextComponent object in their constructor and modify the rendering of the text by adding HTML <b> or <i> tags, respectively.

4. In the client code, we create a PlainText object and then decorate it with BoldDecorator and ItalicDecorator to format the text as bold, italic, or both. We can dynamically combine these decorators to achieve different text formatting styles.
