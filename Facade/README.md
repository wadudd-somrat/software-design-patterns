1. We have three subsystems (SubsystemA, SubsystemB, and SubsystemC) that represent different parts of a complex system. Each subsystem has its own methods.

2. We create a Facade class that serves as a simplified interface to these subsystems. The Facade class initializes instances of the subsystems and provides high-level methods (operation_1 and operation_2) that coordinate the actions of the subsystems to perform more complex operations.

3. In the client code, we create an instance of the Facade and use it to perform operations. The client code doesn't need to know the details of how the subsystems work or interact; it only interacts with the Facade.
