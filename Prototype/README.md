1. We create a Prototype base class with a clone method. In Python, we use copy.deepcopy to create a deep copy of the object, which effectively clones it.

2. We create two concrete prototype classes, ConcretePrototype1 and ConcretePrototype2, each with its own data fields and __str__ method for printing.

3. In the client code, we create instances of the concrete prototypes (prototype1 and prototype2) and then create clones (clone1 and clone2) by calling the clone method on the prototypes. Python's copy.deepcopy method ensures that the clones are entirely independent objects.
