1. We define a Visitor interface with methods visit_file and visit_directory to visit different types of elements in the file system structure.

2. We create a concrete Visitor class, ListVisitor, that implements the Visitor interface. This class defines the behavior for visiting files and directories.

3. We define an FileSystemElement interface with an accept method. Each concrete element class, such as File and Directory, will implement this accept method.

4. We create two concrete element classes, File and Directory, both of which implement the FileSystemElement interface. Directory can have children, which can be either files or subdirectories.

5. In the client code, we create a file system structure with files and directories. We add these elements to the structure and then use the ListVisitor to visit the structure, which prints out information about each file and directory visited.
